      <description>My name is David Wilde.
My background is in economics. These days I&amp;rsquo;m highly interested in Data Science applications in payment risk management.
This is accompanied by exercising and constantly improving my leadership skills and studying and practicing decision making under uncertainty.
I love to read alot about the above mentioned topics.</description>

      <description>This is the start of my personal website. And instead of writing some generic, somewhat empty first post saying &amp;lsquo;Hello World!&#39;. I instead want to write about how I created this website. Foremost as a tutorial for myself.</description>
